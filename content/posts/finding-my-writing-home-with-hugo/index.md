Lately, I've been spending some time exploring Hugo, an open-source static site generator. I didn't get interested in it for no reason. I've loved writing since junior high school, and over the years I've jumped between different writing platforms, starting from Blogger, then WordPress, and later Medium. Blogger feels outdated now, WordPress requires too much setup, and Medium just doesn't feel very user-friendly to me.

Hugo feels like the right answer to my need for a simple place to write casual thoughts straight from my head. I was already familiar with Markdown from writing programming documentation in the past, so there was basically no learning curve. On top of that, Hugo has a lot of clean, minimalist themes, which I really like.

The installation experience was also surprisingly smooth on Arch Linux. Just one command:

```bash
sudo pacman -S hugo
```

and I immediately got the extended version. After a full day of tinkering, I finally found a setup that feels perfect for me. I can write freely without worrying about hosting or domains by using GitHub Pages and GitHub Actions. The documentation for setting everything up is already well written on the official Hugo website, which makes the whole process even easier.

Another reason behind this website is someone I know named Ahmad Saugi. Recently, he's been practicing what I'd call atomic habits. He writes short, lightweight notes about what he learns each day. Seeing that really inspired me and pushed me to finally build this site. He also uses Hugo and even created his own theme, which is honestly pretty impressive. You can check out his website at https://til.saugi.me.

I hope I can stay consistent writing here. For me, this is the easiest and simplest way to write. No overthinking, no unnecessary setup. Just getting what's in my head out and turning it into words.
