Designing for attention starts with defending your own. This is a short field guide to protect focus without turning into a monk.

## The Rule of One Window

Keep one intentional window open: the one where the work happens. Every extra tab is a tiny promise you will break later.

## A Tiny Checklist

- What must exist when I stop today?
- What is the smallest version that proves the idea?
- What can I delete without guilt?

## A Quote That Helps

> If you don’t guard your time, the internet will schedule it for you.

## A Small Table

| Signal | Noise | Replace With |
| --- | --- | --- |
| endless tabs | false options | a short list |
| alerts | fragmented time | a single inbox |
| vague goals | drift | a clear deliverable |

## A Compact Timeline

1. Morning: produce the core artifact
2. Midday: tighten and ship the smallest slice
3. Evening: record what to fix next

## A Pull Quote

{{< lead >}}
Make the work visible, make the scope small, make the finish real.
{{< /lead >}}

## A Callout

{{< alert >}}
No tool will rescue a vague goal. Tools amplify clarity or confusion.
{{< /alert >}}

## An Image

Add a header image by placing an asset next to this file or in `assets/` and referencing it in front matter.

## A Little Math

When you care about sharpness, you pick fewer things and do them better.

37503\text{focus} = \frac{\text{intention}}{\text{distraction} + 1}37503

## The Close

The hardest part of creating is making a clear line. I stop here so tomorrow has a place to begin.
