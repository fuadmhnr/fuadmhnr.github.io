# When Music Saves You From the City

I’ve always had this itch to dig into new things, whether it’s tech experiments or chasing fresh sounds in music. And sometimes, the best discoveries don’t come from endless scrolling, but from a friend who knows you too well.

Zulfikar, one of my closest buddies, recently dropped a recommendation: a track called **“Kota Lelah”** by a band named **Fleuro**. He knows I’m a sucker for shoegaze, so he figured I’d vibe with it. The funny thing is, I didn’t even need to hit play to feel curious... the title alone pulled me in. And when I finally listened, it was instant connection.

## Jakarta, the Tired City

That song hit me hard because it reminded me of **Jakarta**. If you’ve lived here, you know what I mean, the city feels exhausting. The pace is relentless, people move like they’re in their own bubbles, and the cost of living keeps climbing. It’s a city that drains you, no sugarcoating it.

Back when I first started my career as a programmer, Jakarta was my training ground. I survived the daily grind of traffic jams on Gatot Subroto and Daan Mogot. Honestly, those roads became my second home. And here’s the truth: if it weren’t for music, I might’ve gone crazy stuck in that chaos. Music was my escape, my sanity check.

## Discovering Fleuro

So who’s behind “Kota Lelah”? Fleuro, a shoegaze band from Surabaya. And here’s the thing: Surabaya keeps producing incredible shoegaze acts. **Enola** is from there too, and I’m obsessed with their work.

Fleuro’s lineup is pretty unique:

- 2 guitarists
- 1 bassist
- 1 drummer
- 2 vocalists (yep, two!)

And guess what? They’re all women. At first, I was like, _“Wait, two vocalists? How does that even work?”_ But then I heard **Indy Sellen** (aka _Sellen Ravindy_) and **Amoretta** (aka _Aliafi_) sing together, and it just clicked. Their voices complement each other beautifully.

Formed in 2019, Fleuro is still young in the scene, but their new EP **Sonic Archives** proves they’re already carving out something special. “Kota Lelah” is part of that release, and honestly, every track I’ve heard so far feels solid. Most are upbeat, but they all carry that dreamy shoegaze texture that keeps me coming back.

If you really want to feel their energy, check out Fleuro’s live performance at Pelatar. Watching them play live is a whole different experience. it’s raw, powerful, and you can tell they’re pouring themselves into every note.

Music like this reminds me why I keep digging. It’s not just about finding new sounds... it’s about finding pieces of yourself in them. And for me, Fleuro’s “Kota Lelah” is more than a song. It’s a mirror of the city I’ve lived in, survived, and somehow learned to live through music.
