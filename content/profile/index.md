## What I do

I build lean products, write about craft, and ship small experiments weekly.

## Principles

- Ship the smallest viable artifact
- Make decisions in public
- Prefer clarity to cleverness

## Working With Me

I like projects that have clear goals, short feedback loops, and honest constraints.
