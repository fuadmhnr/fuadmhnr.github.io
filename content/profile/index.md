## What I do ✍

Hi, I’m Fuad Muhammad Nur, but you can call me Fuad.

I’m a website developer who focuses on building web-based applications. I’ve been doing this professionally since 2021, starting from my first full-time job. Even before that, I was already coding a lot. Back in college, I took on thesis programming projects for friends from the same major. It was not the best idea, but it became one of the fastest ways for me to learn and grow as a developer.

I’ve worked with many tools and technologies over the years. Right now, my main focus is Laravel. In previous roles, I’ve also worked with Node.js, React with TypeScript, .NET Web API, and several internal frameworks. For databases, I’m most comfortable with relational databases like MariaDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.

Outside of coding, I enjoy writing. I’ve liked writing since junior high school. I used to write on Blogger, and now I write here to share my thoughts and experiences. I also enjoy listening to music and watching movies. Both help me slow down, reset, and stay inspired.

## Working With Me 🤝

I enjoy working on projects that start with clear goals and solid planning. From my experience, having a well-defined direction early on helps avoid major changes halfway through development, which can slow everything down and drain energy. I value clarity, consistency, and commitment in both projects and people. I respect those who know what they stand for and are not afraid to stick to their principles.
