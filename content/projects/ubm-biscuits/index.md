## Background

UBM Biscuits is a food manufacturing company producing a wide variety of baked goods and snacks including biscuits, cookies, marie, assorted selections, wafers, and more. Their market reach is extensive, especially across Java, with distribution expanding throughout Indonesia.

Previously, they had an official website, but the design felt outdated. They wanted a fresher and more modern look, along with better insights into visitor traffic and performance. This led to the decision to redevelop their website.

## What We Built

We rebuilt their website using WordPress, as the team was already familiar with the platform. The new design is fresh, user friendly, modern, and highlights UBM Biscuits’ products more effectively. Through this revamped site, we also successfully supported their “Rainy Season of Money” campaign.

## My Role

My responsibilities in this project included:

- Converting HTML slicing into a custom WordPress theme
- Updating and uploading product data and content
- Creating monthly Google Analytics reports
- Performing monthly backups of the project and database
- Implementing Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager
- Optimizing website performance

## Tech Stack

The tools I used for this project included WordPress and several powerful plugins such as WPML, ACF Pro, Yoast SEO, and WPForms.

## Challenge

This project was particularly challenging because it was the very first WordPress-based project I handled. Even though it was a company profile website, it pushed me to solve real problems.

One challenge was designing ACF forms that could be easily understood by non technical users. Another was optimizing the site’s load speed. At one point, the client reported that the website felt slow, even though our demo server and local tests showed fast responses.

To address this, I optimized assets, converted images to WebP format, applied caching strategies, and fine tuned asset delivery. Fortunately, the server used LiteSpeed, which helped achieve excellent performance. In the end, the page load speed met expectations, the client was satisfied, and PageSpeed Insights scored the site above 90.

## What I Learned

Although WordPress is sometimes underestimated, this project taught me a lot about the framework. I learned how to efficiently retrieve data, build forms that are not only functional but also self explanatory for non technical users, and implement tools like Google Analytics, SEO strategies, and Google Tag Manager.

I also gained deeper knowledge of how WordPress works, including the structure of custom theme directories and best practices for optimization.
