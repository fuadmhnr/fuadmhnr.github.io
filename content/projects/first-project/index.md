A tiny project focused on one thing: turn chaos into a short, daily mission list.

## Why it exists

Most planning tools reward collecting tasks, not finishing them. Compass rewards finishing.

## What it does

- A daily mission list with a hard limit of 3
- A one line outcome for each mission
- A graceful archive so you can see momentum

## How it works

1. Capture anything in a quick inbox.
2. Promote only what matters to today.
3. Ship three things, then stop.

## Notes

Swap the example images with local assets later. Congo will optimize local images through Hugo Pipes.
