Their market reach is extensive, especially across Java, with distribution expanding throughout Indonesia.\nPreviously, they had an official website, but the design felt outdated. They wanted a fresher and more modern look, along with better insights into visitor traffic and performance. This led to the decision to redevelop their website.\nWhat We Built #We rebuilt their website using WordPress, as the team was already familiar with the platform. The new design is fresh, user friendly, modern, and highlights UBM Biscuits’ products more effectively. Through this revamped site, we also successfully supported their “Rainy Season of Money” campaign.\nMy Role #My responsibilities in this project included:\nConverting HTML slicing into a custom WordPress theme Updating and uploading product data and content Creating monthly Google Analytics reports Performing monthly backups of the project and database Implementing Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager Optimizing website performance Tech Stack #The tools I used for this project included WordPress and several powerful plugins such as WPML, ACF Pro, Yoast SEO, and WPForms.\nChallenge #This project was particularly challenging because it was the very first WordPress-based project I handled. Even though it was a company profile website, it pushed me to solve real problems.\nOne challenge was designing ACF forms that could be easily understood by non technical users. Another was optimizing the site’s load speed. At one point, the client reported that the website felt slow, even though our demo server and local tests showed fast responses.\nTo address this, I optimized assets, converted images to WebP format, applied caching strategies, and fine tuned asset delivery. Fortunately, the server used LiteSpeed, which helped achieve excellent performance. In the end, the page load speed met expectations, the client was satisfied, and PageSpeed Insights scored the site above 90.\nWhat I Learned #Although WordPress is sometimes underestimated, this project taught me a lot about the framework. I learned how to efficiently retrieve data, build forms that are not only functional but also self explanatory for non technical users, and implement tools like Google Analytics, SEO strategies, and Google Tag Manager.\nI also gained deeper knowledge of how WordPress works, including the structure of custom theme directories and best practices for optimization.\nScreens # Homepage Product Slider Product Showcase Links #The website already live, yeay!

And sometimes, the best discoveries don’t come from endless scrolling, but from a friend who knows you too well.\nZulfikar, one of my closest buddies, recently dropped a recommendation: a track called “Kota Lelah” by a band named Fleuro. He knows I’m a sucker for shoegaze, so he figured I’d vibe with it. The funny thing is, I didn’t even need to hit play to feel curious\u0026hellip; the title alone pulled me in. And when I finally listened, it was instant connection.\nJakarta, the Tired City #That song hit me hard because it reminded me of Jakarta. If you’ve lived here, you know what I mean, the city feels exhausting. The pace is relentless, people move like they’re in their own bubbles, and the cost of living keeps climbing. It’s a city that drains you, no sugarcoating it.\nBack when I first started my career as a programmer, Jakarta was my training ground. I survived the daily grind of traffic jams on Gatot Subroto and Daan Mogot. Honestly, those roads became my second home. And here’s the truth: if it weren’t for music, I might’ve gone crazy stuck in that chaos. Music was my escape, my sanity check.\nDiscovering Fleuro #So who’s behind “Kota Lelah”? Fleuro, a shoegaze band from Surabaya. And here’s the thing: Surabaya keeps producing incredible shoegaze acts. Enola is from there too, and I’m obsessed with their work.\nFleuro’s lineup is pretty unique:\n2 guitarists 1 bassist 1 drummer 2 vocalists (yep, two!) And guess what? They’re all women. At first, I was like, “Wait, two vocalists? How does that even work?” But then I heard Indy Sellen (aka Sellen Ravindy) and Amoretta (aka Aliafi) sing together, and it just clicked. Their voices complement each other beautifully.\nFormed in 2019, Fleuro is still young in the scene, but their new EP Sonic Archives proves they’re already carving out something special. “Kota Lelah” is part of that release, and honestly, every track I’ve heard so far feels solid. Most are upbeat, but they all carry that dreamy shoegaze texture that keeps me coming back.\nThe Magic of Live Performance # If you really want to feel their energy, check out Fleuro’s live performance at Pelatar. Watching them play live is a whole different experience. it’s raw, powerful, and you can tell they’re pouring themselves into every note.\nMusic like this reminds me why I keep digging. It’s not just about finding new sounds\u0026hellip; it’s about finding pieces of yourself in them. And for me, Fleuro’s “Kota Lelah” is more than a song. It’s a mirror of the city I’ve lived in, survived, and somehow learned to live through music.\n","date":"8 January 2026","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/when-music-saved-you-from-the-city/","section":"Posts","summary":"Discover how I found Fleuro’s shoegaze gem “Kota Lelah” and why it perfectly mirrors the exhausting vibe of Jakarta.

The system was based on a heavily customized CodeIgniter 3 application with MySQL as the database. Over time, this setup started to show its limitations, especially in how data was fetched and rendered on certain pages.\nPerformance issues aside, the visual design also felt outdated and no longer matched modern design standards. At this point, the client decided that a simple facelift was not enough and chose to move forward with a full revamp or redevelopment.\nWhat We Built #We rebuilt the website using a more modern stack with a cleaner and more lightweight user interface. The main goal was to make the site feel fresher, faster, and easier to maintain, both from a technical and content management perspective.\nSome of the improvements we focused on were:\nBetter and more efficient data querying Cleaner SEO metadata handling Replacing Bootstrap with Tailwind CSS for a lighter UI A more structured and scalable CMS setup The result is a website that feels more modern and performs better, while still being flexible enough for future changes.\nMy Role #I worked as part of a team and focused mainly on the backend side of the project.\nMy responsibilities included:\nBuilding and maintaining the CMS Connecting backend data to the frontend Refactoring static HTML into reusable Blade components Handling deployment to the internal demo server Migrating data from the legacy application into the new system Tech Stack # Laravel Filament\nUsed to build the CMS and backend logic. It helped speed up development and made customization much easier.\nDGTemplates\nAn internal frontend framework used to slice designs from Figma into optimized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The output is already minified and performance friendly.\nMySQL\nUsed as the main database for storing structured content.\nChallenges and Trade offs #One of the trickiest parts of this project was figuring out how content should be structured and presented, both on the public website and inside the CMS. The CMS needed to be simple enough for non technical users, but still powerful enough to handle structured content and SEO metadata properly.\nTo solve this, I implemented a page template system inspired by ACF in WordPress. Filament made this much easier since it is highly customizable. I also introduced an image curator approach so a single image could be reused across multiple pages, which helped reduce data duplication.\nFor performance, all assets were converted to WebP to keep file sizes small. I also added Content Security Policy headers as a baseline security measure, even though the client will run periodic VAPT checks.\nWhat I Learned #This project helped me better understand how to handle structured content across multiple languages, especially English and Indonesian. I learned how to design content models that stay consistent between CMS input and frontend output.\nWorking with page templates also gave me a deeper understanding of flexible content architectures and how similar concepts from WordPress can be applied cleanly in a Laravel based CMS.\nScreens # Homepage Prima ATM Prima News Links #Links will be added once the project is publicly available.\n","date":"3 January 2026","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/projects/jaringan-prima/","section":"Projects","summary":"A multi-language company profile rebuild focused on performance, a cleaner CMS, and a modern UI.","title":"Project: Jaringan Prima"},{"content":"Lately, I\u0026rsquo;ve been spending some time exploring Hugo, an open-source static site generator. I didn\u0026rsquo;t get interested in it for no reason. I\u0026rsquo;ve loved writing since junior high school, and over the years I\u0026rsquo;ve jumped between different writing platforms, starting from Blogger, then WordPress, and later Medium. Blogger feels outdated now, WordPress requires too much setup, and Medium just doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel very user-friendly to me.\nHugo feels like the right answer to my need for a simple place to write casual thoughts straight from my head. I was already familiar with Markdown from writing programming documentation in the past, so there was basically no learning curve. On top of that, Hugo has a lot of clean, minimalist themes, which I really like.\nThe installation experience was also surprisingly smooth on Arch Linux. Just one command:\nsudo pacman -S hugo and I immediately got the extended version. After a full day of tinkering, I finally found a setup that feels perfect for me. I can write freely without worrying about hosting or domains by using GitHub Pages and GitHub Actions. The documentation for setting everything up is already well written on the official Hugo website, which makes the whole process even easier.\nAnother reason behind this website is someone I know named Ahmad Saugi. Recently, he\u0026rsquo;s been practicing what I\u0026rsquo;d call atomic habits. He writes short, lightweight notes about what he learns each day. Seeing that really inspired me and pushed me to finally build this site. He also uses Hugo and even created his own theme, which is honestly pretty impressive. You can check out his website at https://til.saugi.me.\nI hope I can stay consistent writing here. For me, this is the easiest and simplest way to write. No overthinking, no unnecessary setup. Just getting what\u0026rsquo;s in my head out and turning it into words.\n","date":"2 January 2026","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/finding-my-writing-home-with-hugo/","section":"Posts","summary":"A short story about how I discovered Hugo, why it fits my writing style, and how it helps me write freely without worrying about platforms, hosting, or complexity.","title":"Finding My Writing Home with Hugo"},{"content":" Fuad Muhammad Nur Your lovely website developer What I do ✍ #Hi, I’m Fuad Muhammad Nur, but you can call me Fuad.\nI’m a website developer who focuses on building web-based applications. I’ve been doing this professionally since 2021, starting from my first full-time job. Even before that, I was already coding a lot. Back in college, I took on thesis programming projects for friends from the same major. It was not the best idea, but it became one of the fastest ways for me to learn and grow as a developer.\nI’ve worked with many tools and technologies over the years. Right now, my main focus is Laravel. In previous roles, I’ve also worked with Node.js, React with TypeScript, .NET Web API, and several internal frameworks. For databases, I’m most comfortable with relational databases like MariaDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.\nOutside of coding, I enjoy writing. I’ve liked writing since junior high school. I used to write on Blogger, and now I write here to share my thoughts and experiences. I also enjoy listening to music and watching movies. Both help me slow down, reset, and stay inspired.\nWorking With Me 🤝 #I enjoy working on projects that start with clear goals and solid planning. From my experience, having a well-defined direction early on helps avoid major changes halfway through development, which can slow everything down and drain energy. I value clarity, consistency, and commitment in both projects and people.
