[{"content":"Lately, I\u0026rsquo;ve been spending some time exploring Hugo, an open-source static site generator. I didn\u0026rsquo;t get interested in it for no reason. I\u0026rsquo;ve loved writing since junior high school, and over the years I\u0026rsquo;ve jumped between different writing platforms, starting from Blogger, then WordPress, and later Medium. Blogger feels outdated now, WordPress requires too much setup, and Medium just doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel very user-friendly to me.\nHugo feels like the right answer to my need for a simple place to write casual thoughts straight from my head. I was already familiar with Markdown from writing programming documentation in the past, so there was basically no learning curve. On top of that, Hugo has a lot of clean, minimalist themes, which I really like.\nThe installation experience was also surprisingly smooth on Arch Linux. Just one command:\nsudo pacman -S hugo and I immediately got the extended version. After a full day of tinkering, I finally found a setup that feels perfect for me. I can write freely without worrying about hosting or domains by using GitHub Pages and GitHub Actions. The documentation for setting everything up is already well written on the official Hugo website, which makes the whole process even easier.\nAnother reason behind this website is someone I know named Ahmad Saugi. Recently, he\u0026rsquo;s been practicing what I\u0026rsquo;d call atomic habits. He writes short, lightweight notes about what he learns each day. Seeing that really inspired me and pushed me to finally build this site. He also uses Hugo and even created his own theme, which is honestly pretty impressive. You can check out his website at https://til.saugi.me.\nI hope I can stay consistent writing here. For me, this is the easiest and simplest way to write. No overthinking, no unnecessary setup. Just getting what\u0026rsquo;s in my head out and turning it into words.\n","date":"2 January 2026","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/finding-my-writing-home-with-hugo/","section":"Posts","summary":"A short story about how I discovered Hugo, why it fits my writing style, and how it helps me write freely without worrying about platforms, hosting, or complexity.","title":"Finding My Writing Home with Hugo"},{"content":"Welcome to my corner of the web.

I’ve been doing this professionally since 2021, starting from my first full-time job. Even before that, I was already coding a lot. Back in college, I took on thesis programming projects for friends from the same major. It was not the best idea, but it became one of the fastest ways for me to learn and grow as a developer.\nI’ve worked with many tools and technologies over the years. Right now, my main focus is Laravel. In previous roles, I’ve also worked with Node.js, React with TypeScript, .NET Web API, and several internal frameworks. For databases, I’m most comfortable with relational databases like MariaDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.\nOutside of coding, I enjoy writing. I’ve liked writing since junior high school. I used to write on Blogger, and now I write here to share my thoughts and experiences. I also enjoy listening to music and watching movies. Both help me slow down, reset, and stay inspired.\nWorking With Me 🤝 #I enjoy working on projects that start with clear goals and solid planning. From my experience, having a well-defined direction early on helps avoid major changes halfway through development, which can slow everything down and drain energy. I value clarity, consistency, and commitment in both projects and people. I respect those who know what they stand for and are not afraid to stick to their principles.\nContact 📩 #Use the social links in the profile card or send a direct email at fuadmhnr@proton.me\n","date":"2 January 2026","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/profile/","section":"Home","summary":"","title":"Profile"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"http://localhost:1313/topics/tech-notes/","section":"Topics","summary":"","title":"Tech Notes"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"http://localhost:1313/topics/","section":"Topics","summary":"","title":"Topics"},{"content":"A tiny project focused on one thing: turn chaos into a short, daily mission list.\nWhy it exists #Most planning tools reward collecting tasks, not finishing them.
